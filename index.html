						I am interested in studying how climate change affects the Ecological, 
						evolutionary and epidemiological dynamics of infectious diseases.
						To do this I use genomics data generated from infected hosts and vectors to understand
						the epidemiological links between cases using computational tools.
						This data can tell us a story of the pathogen's evolution through time, and we can model
						it's spread by using mathematical frameworks.

						Since 2018, when I started my research career I quickly became fascinated by the world of viruses and its extense diversity.
						Tropical Viruses such as Dengue, Zika, Chikungunya, Hantavirus, among others, caused high-burden in my country and other tropical countries around the world.
						But it was when the COVID-19 pandemic hit that I started working in designing, developing an validating molecular and serological assays that would allow low-to-middle 
						income countries to carry accurate and fast diagnostics for viral diseases. 
						<br>
						As a part of my experience at Professor Mattar's lab, I developed RT-qPCR assays for the detection of Hantaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 as well as ELISA and LFA tests for detecting
						anti-Hantavirus IgG antibodies in humans and rodents. During the early stages of the pandemic, I voluntereed to carry out viral isolation for diagnostic of hospitalized patients in my region.
						<br>
						Nowadays, my research is coming back to it's Arboviral ways, with research interests on studying the effect of climate on the transmission and evolution of these viruses in aims
						to inform policies that shape an estrategy of public health preparedness.
